# Extractor

**Extractor** is a command-line tool that simplifies working with large codebases when seeking AI assistance (e.g., ChatGPT). Instead of manually copying and pasting files one by one, Extractor automatically generates a single, organized file containing your projectâ€™s file structure and content. This makes it easy to provide a full view of your codebase to AI tools, allowing for smoother, more efficient coding and debugging assistance.

## Features

- **Easy File Structure Extraction**: Extracts the file structure of your project directory.
- **Content Compilation**: Compiles the content of all text files in the specified directory and subdirectories into one output file.
- **Ideal for AI Assistance**: Provides a single, comprehensive file for AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to understand your codebase, eliminating the need for tedious copy-pasting.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
